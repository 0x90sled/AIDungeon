        <h2> About AI Dungeon </h2>
          <text> 
    AI Dungeon is an AI generated text adventure that uses deep learning to create each adventure. It uses OpenAI's new <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2 model</a>, which has 117 million parameters, to generate each story block and possible action. 
    
    <br><br> The first couple sentences of AIDungeon and the action verbs are handcrafted, but everything else is not. Each time an option is chosen, the initial prompt, the last story block, and the last action are fed into the neural network. The resulting story and action options are then output by the model.
    
    <br><br> As you can probably tell there's still a ways to go before AI will be your group's dungeon master, but even after running hundreds of adventures it still manages to surprise me in interesting ways.

    <br><br> I hope you enjoy exploring the strange dreams of AIDungeon.
