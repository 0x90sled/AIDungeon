 You enter the first door and see an old man in tattered robes. He is covered in dirt and grime. His eyes are sunken into his head as if he's been crying.

 "Hello?"

 "I'm here to kill you."

 The old man looks up from where he was crouching.

 "I don't know what you're talking about."

 "You have no idea how much you scare me."

 "What do you mean?"

 "You're not going down there without me or your daughter."

 My heart drops.

 "Are you crazy?"

 "No, I'm not. You need to go back home right now."

 "Why would I? You're just scaring me!"

 "Don't be silly. Go on ahead then."

 "But why should I?"

 "Because it's your only way out."

 "Why?"

 "Because you'll never get out alive. If you don't, I'll come after you. And then we'll both die."

 "Why? Why me?"

 "Because you've done something terrible. Something so terrible it will haunt you forever. You'll always remember this day because it'll forever change everything."

 "How can you say that?"
Horror Text: I enter a dungeon with my trusty sword and shield. I am searching for the evil necromancer who killed my family. I've heard that he resides at the bottom of the dungeon, guarded by legions of the undead. I enter the first door and see an old man in tattered robes. He is covered in dirt and grime. His eyes are sunken into his head as if he's been crying.
